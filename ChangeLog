2011-10-03  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* Ported our patch for mailing list expansion from
	0.9 to 1.0b2. Also updated the Mozilla ticket regarding
	this: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=459021

	* Modified imip-bar.js and calDavCalendar.js to allow
	REQUEST:UPDATE to work just like standard REQUEST methods.
	This allows Lightning to show the accept/decline/tentative
	buttons for invitation updates.

2011-08-02  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* Added a patch from Mohit Singh Kanwal <mohit.kanwal@gmail.com>
	which is a port of our reresh killer to TB3 (bug #502936).

2010-10-27  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/content/widgets/calendar-list-tree.xml:
	(nsITreeView.calObserver.onLoad) invoke SCComputeEnableNewItems to
	reenable the creation menu entries when the calendars become
	ready.

2010-10-18  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/providers/caldav/calDavRequestHandlers.js:
	(etagsListener.onStopRequest): invoke "onLoad" notification for
	non-cached calendars whether new items have been fetched or not,
	to finalize the refresh UI actions. Fixed typos prevents passing
	of the changelog listener to the multiget handler.

2010-10-05  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/providers/caldav/calDavCalendar.js
	(safeRefresh_safeRefresh_onStreamComplete): notify "onLoad" on
	observers when the current calendar is not a cached calendar.

2010-09-17  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/providers/caldav/calDavCalendar.js:
	(safeRefresh_safeRefresh_onStreamComplete): make the try/catch
	useful with regards to the "request" variable.

2010-09-15  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	src/calendar/providers/caldav/calDavCalendar.js
	* Dropped mReadOnly and mDisabled since we
	already have readOnly and disabled and all
	fours were conflicting

2010-09-07  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* Fixed the repackage.sh script to properly place
	calbase.xpt in the components directory
	* Included patch for bug
	https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=585005
	which was part of our GSoC project with Mozilla
	* Regenerated calbase.xpt because of the idl changes
	from the patch above
	* src/calendar/providers/caldav/calDavCalendar.js
	Modified so we support EMAIL and DISPLAY alarm
	properties (capabilities.alarms.actionValues)
	on the calendar.
	* Adjusted all DTD to include the new strings 

2010-09-02  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-month-view.xml,
	src/calendar/base/content/calendar-multiday-view.xml: added a
	"item-classification-box" image next to the alarm-icons-box
	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-view-core.xml: added code to
	set the classification of the item corresponding to the
	represented box so that we can display a proper icon.

2010-08-26  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/lightning/content/imip-bar.js:
	(ltnIsSchedulingCalendar) return true also when caldav accounts
	support auto-schedule.

2010-08-10  Ludovic Marcotte  <lmarcotte@inverse.ca>

	* We check for item.calendar instanceof
	Components.interfaces.calISchedulingSupport prior
	calling isInvitation() on it in
	calendar-view-core.xml and calendar-multiday-view.xml

2010-07-30  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/providers/storage/calStorageCalendar.js:
	(calStorageCalendar.flushItem): since deleteItemById creates a
	transaction, we cannot create one before the method is invoked.
	(acquireTransaction): removed transaction counters, thereby making
	this method a simple wrapper for "this.mDB.beginTransaction".
	(releaseTransaction): same as the above with the exception that a
	rollback is still performed when an error is passed as parameter.
	(startBatch): no longer acquire a transaction, therefore removed
	method.
	(endBatch): no longer release the current transaction, therefore
	removed method.

2010-07-28  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/lightning/content/imip-bar.js: reverted to the
	original version of the file.
	(ltnOnItipItem.observe): split the method: the button display code
	has been put in a callback to a multiple refresh operation,
	implemented by the new class below.
	(refreshCalendars): new method requesting the refresh of the array
	of calendars passed as parameter, using the new class below.
	(imipBarRefreshObserver): new class acting as a calendar observer
	for processing a single callback after all calendars in question
	have been refreshed.
	(ltnOnCalendarsRefreshed): new callback, mentionned above, which
	takes in charge the displaying of corresponding buttons and
	requesting the itip processing of the item.

	* src/calendar/base/src/calUtils.js: (calGetString): return the
	original string when the translation has not been found.

2010-07-27  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/lightning/content/imip-bar.js: (setupMsgIdentities)
	fixed retrieval of current message.

2010-07-26  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* repackage.sh: ensure that everything in
	$BASE/src/calendar/lightning/content/ gets copied to
	content/lightning/, except lightning.js which is a pref file.

2010-07-23  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/lightning/content/imip-bar.js: (setupMsgIdentities)
	added missing method.

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-view-core.xml:
	(calendar-editable-item.handlers.draggesture): same as below.

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-multiday-view.xml:
	(calendar-event-column.startSweepingToModifyEvent): return if the
	current item is an invitation.

	* src/calendar/lightning/content/lightning-utils.js:
	(ltnInitMailIdentitiesRow): take the identities from the acl entry
	corresponding to the current calendar if the latter is of type
	"caldav".

	* src/calendar/base/content/dialogs/calendar-event-dialog.js:
	(updateCalendar) access to cached/uncached calendars must be done
	via the wrappedCalendar object.

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-item-editing.js:
	(openEventDialog) restored the "initialDate" parameter.
	Consequently, restored the initialStartDateValue argument for the
	editing window. Also, restored the "onNewTodo" argument.

2010-07-22  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-common-sets.js,
	src/calendar/base/content/calendar-unifinder.js,
	src/calendar/base/content/widgets/calendar-list-tree.xml: migrated
	ACL code from SOGo Connector for handling the "calendar_new_XXX"
	and "calendar_delete_XXX" UI commands.

	* src/calendar/lightning/content/lightning-calendar-properties.js
	(onLoad): added ACL code.

	* src/calendar/base/src/calUtils.js: (isCalendarWritable) added
	code that makes use of the CalDAV ACL mgr...

	* src/calendar/base/content/dialogs/calendar-event-dialog.js:
	(updateCalendar): added code to load the acl entry for the
	calendar item being editted, from sogo-connector acl code.
	(saveItem): check whether the item is its own parent in order to
	decide whether to set the item's organizer or not.

	* src/calendar/base/content/calendar-ui-utils.js:
	(appendCalendarItems) added code to check whether the list of
	calendars only includes calendars where the user can add events,
	from sogo-connector acl code.

	* src/calendar/acl/caldav-acl-manager/CalDAVACLManager.js:
	migrated from sogo-connector.

2010-07-21  Wolfgang Sourdeau  <wsourdeau@inverse.ca>

	* src/calendar/providers/caldav/calDavCalendar.js: (getProperty):
	fixed a crash by returning the first owner's identity rather than
	a copy of it when "imip.identity" is queried.
	(*) "lettified" the whole module.
